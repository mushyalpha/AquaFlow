## 1. Executive Summary

This project implements a real time DC Conveyor Water Filling Machine on a Raspberry Pi 5 using C++. The system automatically detects bottles on a moving conveyor belt, stops the belt when a bottle is positioned under the nozzle, fills the bottle to a target volume using a flow meter, then restarts the belt to advance the next bottle. The entire process is controlled by a real time state machine running at a 20ms loop.

The project is modelled directly on industrial bottling line automation.

> **Hard real time consequence of missing a deadline:** At a flow rate of 500 ml/min, the solenoid valve dispenses ~8.3 ml/sec. If the valve-close ISR is delayed by more than 5 ms, the bottle overfills.

---

## 2. Problem Statement & Motivation

Manual water bottling is slow, inconsistent in fill volume and labour intensive. Industrial bottling plants solve this with automated conveyor based filling lines, but these systems are very expensive. This project demonstrates that the same fundamental automation concept: **detect, stop, fill, advance** can be implemented on an affordable single board computer using real-time C++, achieving fill accuracy comparable to commercial systems.

The core engineering challenges are:
- Detecting a bottle in the correct position reliably using an IR sensor
- Measuring dispensed volume accurately using pulse counting from a flow meter
- Ensuring the solenoid valve closes at exactly the right moment to hit the target volume
- Coordinating the conveyor motor and valve as a coherent real-time system with no race conditions or timing errors

### The Complete Filling Cycle — One Bottle

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| **Step 1** — Belt RUNNING | Conveyor motor ON, belt moving forward |
| **Step 2** — Bottle DETECTED | IR sensor fires GPIO interrupt → belt stops immediately |
| **Step 3** — FILLING begins | Solenoid valve opens, flow meter starts counting pulses |
| **Step 4** — Volume reached | Pulse count × 2.25ml >= 500ml → valve closes instantly |
| **Step 5** — SETTLE wait | 200ms pause — water stops flowing, no drip |
| **Step 6** — Belt RESTARTS | Motor ON, filled bottle moves away, next bottle arrives |
| **Step 7** | Repeat from Step 1 |

## 4. Software Architecture — Class Design (SOLID Principles)

All Raspberry Pi code is written in C++ following SOLID design principles. Each hardware subsystem is encapsulated in its own class with a well-defined public interface.

| Class | Responsibility | Key Methods |
|---|---|---|
| `ConveyorMotor` | Wraps L298N GPIO; drives belt | `start()`, `stop()`, `setSpeed(pwm)` |
| `SolenoidValve` | Wraps relay GPIO; controls water flow | `open()`, `close()` |
| `FlowMeter` | Owns pulse ISR; converts pulses to ml | `getVolumeML()`, `resetCount()`, `registerCallback(fn)` |
| `IRSensor` | Owns GPIO interrupt; notifies on bottle | `registerCallback(fn)`, ISR handler |
| `FillingStateMachine` | Orchestrates state transitions using the above classes | `tick()`, `getState()` |
| `MonitorThread` | Normal-priority thread: LCD, MQTT, CSV log | `start()`, `stop()`, `publish()` |

**SOLID mapping:**
- **S** — Each class owns exactly one subsystem 
- **O** — `IRSensor` and `FlowMeter` accept callbacks so the state machine does not need to be modified to change event handling
- **L** — All hardware classes share a common `IHardwareDevice` interface for testability with mocks
- **I** — `MonitorThread` depends only on a read-only `StatusProvider` interface, not the full state machine
- **D** — `FillingStateMachine` depends on abstractions (`IValve`, `IMotor`, `ISensor`), not concrete GPIO classes — enabling unit testing without hardware

---

## 5. Real-Time Latency Budget

All timing decisions are derived from measured or calculated worst-case latencies.

| Event | Latency Target | Consequence of Miss | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| IR trigger → belt stop | < 5 ms | Bottle misaligned under nozzle | GPIO interrupt → `SCHED_FIFO` 80 state machine tick |
| Flow meter pulse ISR response | < 1 ms | Pulse lost → volume miscounted | `SCHED_FIFO` 90 ISR thread (highest priority) |
| Valve close at target volume | < 2 ms | Overfill by ~16 ml per ms of delay | ISR directly writes GPIO via `close()` |
| LCD / MQTT update | < 500 ms | No user-visible impact | Normal-priority `MonitorThread` (non-RT) |
| State machine loop period | 20 ms | Delayed response to sensor events | `SCHED_FIFO`, `clock_nanosleep` periodic wake |

**Why `SCHED_FIFO` priority 80?** This places the control loop above standard Linux processes (priority 0–20) while reserving priority 99 for kernel interrupt threads and priority 90 for the pulse ISR, ensuring the flow meter ISR always pre-empts the state machine rather than the reverse.

**Settle wait implementation (non-blocking):** The 200 ms post-fill settle delay is implemented as a **non-blocking timed state** — the state machine records the `FILL_COMPLETE` timestamp using `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` and transitions to `BELT_RUNNING` only when the elapsed time exceeds 200 ms on a subsequent 20 ms tick. No `sleep()` or blocking wait is used anywhere in the real-time thread.
